          <h3>Verse 1</h3>
          <p>
            I love You, Lord<br>
            For Your mercy never fails me<br>
            All my days, I've been held in Your hands<br>
            From the moment that I wake up<br>
            <br>
            Until I lay my head<br>
            Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God
          </p>

          <h3>Chorus</h3>
          <p>
            And all my life You have been faithful<br>
            And all my life You have been so, so good<br>
            With every breath that I am able<br>
            Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God
          </p>

          <h3>Verse 2</h3>
          <p>
            I love Your voice<br>
            You have led me through the fire<br>
            In the darkest night<br>
            You are close like no other<br>
            <br>
            I've known You as a Father<br>
            I've known You as a Friend<br>
            And I have lived in the goodness of God
          </p>

          <h3>Chorus</h3>
          <p>
            And all my life You have been faithful<br>
            And all my life You have been so, so good<br>
            With every breath that I am able<br>
            Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God
          </p>

          <h3>Bridge</h3>
          <p>
            Your goodness is running after<br>
            It's running after me<br>
            <br>
            With my life laid down<br>
            I'm surrendered now<br>
            I give You everything<br>
            'Cause Your goodness is running after<br>
            It's running after me
          </p>

          <h3>Chorus</h3>
          <p>
            And all my life You have been faithful<br>
            And all my life You have been so, so good<br>
            With every breath that I am able<br>
            Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God
          </p>
